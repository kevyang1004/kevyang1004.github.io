When we are playing any online games, our IP address or our informantions can be hacked by any other users or company of those games. There are many things that include our informations, and if we want to use our cash to buy the new character or the strongest weapon, it could be caused of hacking. There is another way to be attacked our informations by other people. When we are using any website to download any files, there could be any hacked program or something strange thing in that website. The owner of that program will collet our informations and hack our IP address.

I watched a movie that related with hacking and using computer program to collect other's informations. There was a guy who is really good at using compuer system. What he did to hack other's computer, is he turned on the WIFI hotspot. When the other people connect tha WIFI, he went into device that connected with WIFi. That could be another reason.

As I watched a movie that related with hacking, I thought I could defend with the powershell that the guy in a movie used, but in real case, that was impossible. If I were a person who hacked by the other person, I would get repair from the factory. I thought about using powershell to defend my computer and my informations, it would be super hard.
